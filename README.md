## Project Setup
Follow the steps below to set up your Flutter project on Android and iOS.

### **Android**

#### Minimum Version Configuration
Ensure you meet the minimum version requirements to run the application on Android devices.
In the `android/app/build.gradle` file, verify that `minSdkVersion` is at least 21:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
    ...
}
```

### **IOS**
#### Minimum Version Configuration
Ensure you meet the minimum version requirements to run the application on iOS devices.
In the `ios/Podfile` file, make sure the iOS platform version is at least 13.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '13.0'
```
#### Permission Configuration
1. Add a String property to the app's Info.plist file with the key [NSCameraUsageDescription](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/information_property_list/nscamerausagedescription) and the value as the description for why your app needs camera access.

   <key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
   <string>Camera Permission Description</string>

2. The [permission_handler](https://pub.dev/packages/permission_handler) dependency used by cunning_document_scanner use [macros](https://github.com/Baseflow/flutter-permission-handler/blob/master/permission_handler_apple/ios/Classes/PermissionHandlerEnums.h) to control whether a permission is enabled. Add the following to your `Podfile` file:

   ```ruby
   post_install do |installer|
     installer.pods_project.targets.each do |target|
       ... # Here are some configurations automatically generated by flutter

       # Start of the permission_handler configuration
       target.build_configurations.each do |config|

         # You can enable the permissions needed here. For example to enable camera
         # permission, just remove the `#` character in front so it looks like this:
         #
         # ## dart: PermissionGroup.camera
         # 'PERMISSION_CAMERA=1'
         #
         #  Preprocessor definitions can be found at: https://github.com/Baseflow/flutter-permission-handler/blob/master/permission_handler_apple/ios/Classes/PermissionHandlerEnums.h
         config.build_settings['GCC_PREPROCESSOR_DEFINITIONS'] ||= [
           '$(inherited)',

           ## dart: PermissionGroup.camera
           'PERMISSION_CAMERA=1',
         ]

       end
       # End of the permission_handler configuration
     end
   end
   ```
3. Add this line to your Podfile in your project:

```
pod 'WeScan', :path => '.symlinks/plugins/cuning_document_scanner/ios/WeScan-3.0.0'
```

=> like this below:

```
target 'Runner' do
  use_frameworks!
  use_modular_headers!
  pod 'WeScan', :path => '.symlinks/plugins/cuning_document_scanner/ios/WeScan-3.0.0'
  flutter_install_all_ios_pods File.dirname(File.realpath(__FILE__))
end
```

## How to use ?

The easiest way to get a list of images is:

```
    final imagesPath = await CunningDocumentScanner.getPictures()
```
### Android Specific

There are some features in Android that allow you to adjust the scanner that will be ignored in iOS:

```
    final imagesPath = await CunningDocumentScanner.getPictures(
      androidOptions: const AndroidScannerOptions(
         noOfPages: 1, // Limit the number of pages to 1
         isGalleryImportAllowed: true, // Allow the user to also pick an image from his gallery
         scannerMode: AndroidScannerMode.scannerModeFull,
      )
    )
```
