## Key Features

- Fast and easy document scanning.
- Conversion of document images into digital files.
- Support for both Android and iOS platforms.
- Minimum requirements: API 21 on Android, iOS 13 on iOS.

## Project Setup
Follow the steps below to set up your Flutter project on Android and iOS.

### **Android**

#### Minimum Version Configuration
Ensure you meet the minimum version requirements to run the application on Android devices.
In `android/app/build.gradle`, verify that `minSdkVersion` (or `minSdk`) is at least **21**:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
}
```

### **iOS**

#### Minimum Version Configuration
Ensure you meet the minimum version requirements to run the application on iOS devices:
* Set the **iOS Deployment Target** in Xcode (under Minimum Deployments) to at least **13.0**.
* If your project still uses CocoaPods, make sure the platform version is at least **13.0** in your `ios/Podfile`:

  ```ruby
  platform :ios, '13.0'
  ```

#### Permission Configuration
Add the [NSCameraUsageDescription](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/information_property_list/nscamerausagedescription) key to your app's `ios/Runner/Info.plist` file with a description of why your app needs camera access:

```xml
<key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
<string>Access to the camera is required to scan documents.</string>
```

> [!NOTE]
> Since this plugin has migrated to Swift Package Manager (SPM), and the `permission_handler` dependency (version 12.0.2+) also supports SPM, permissions are now resolved automatically. The dependency scans your app's `Info.plist` and compiles only the code for the permission keys you have declared (e.g., `NSCameraUsageDescription`). You do not need to manually configure preprocessor macros in your `Podfile`.

## How to use ?

The easiest way to get a list of images is:

```dart
   final imagesPath = await CunningDocumentScanner.getPictures();
```
### Android Specific

There are some features in Android that allow you to adjust the scanner that will be ignored in iOS:

```dart
   final imagesPath = await CunningDocumentScanner.getPictures(
      noOfPages: 1, // Limit the number of pages to 1
      isGalleryImportAllowed: true, // Allow the user to also pick an image from his gallery
      androidScannerMode: AndroidScannerMode.base, // Use ML Kit base mode on Android (Optional)
   );
```

### iOS Specific

On iOS it is possible to configure which image format should be used to save of the document scans. Available options are PNG (default) or JPEG. In certain situations the JPEG format could drastically reduce the file size of the final scan. If you choose to use JPEG you can also specify a compression quality, where 0.0 is highest compression (lowest quality) and 1.0 (default) is the lowest compression (highest quality). Example usage is:

Note: VisionKit does not expose a scanner mode or filter toggle on iOS. To disable filters or use only crop/rotation, a custom capture and cropping UI would be required.

```dart
   // Returns images in JPEG format with a compression quality of 50%. 
   final imagesPath = await CunningDocumentScanner.getPictures(
      iosScannerOptions: IosScannerOptions(
         imageFormat: IosImageFormat.jpg,
         jpgCompressionQuality: 0.5,
      ),
   );
```
