## Project Setup
Follow the steps below to set up your Flutter project on Android and iOS.

### **Android**

#### Minimum Version Configuration
Ensure you meet the minimum version requirements to run the application on Android devices.
In the `android/app/build.gradle` file, verify that `minSdkVersion` is at least 21:

```gradle
android {
    ...
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        minSdkVersion 21
        ...
    }
    ...
}
```

### **IOS**
#### Minimum Version Configuration
Ensure you meet the minimum version requirements to run the application on iOS devices.
In the `ios/Podfile` file, make sure the iOS platform version is at least 13.0:

```ruby
platform :ios, '13.0'
```
#### Permission Configuration
1. Add a String property to the app's Info.plist file with the key [NSCameraUsageDescription](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/information_property_list/nscamerausagedescription) and the value as the description for why your app needs camera access.

   <key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
   <string>Camera Permission Description</string>

2. The [permission_handler](https://pub.dev/packages/permission_handler) dependency used by cunning_document_scanner use [macros](https://github.com/Baseflow/flutter-permission-handler/blob/master/permission_handler_apple/ios/Classes/PermissionHandlerEnums.h) to control whether a permission is enabled. Add the following to your `Podfile` file:

   ```ruby
   post_install do |installer|
     installer.pods_project.targets.each do |target|
       ... # Here are some configurations automatically generated by flutter

       # Start of the permission_handler configuration
       target.build_configurations.each do |config|

         # You can enable the permissions needed here. For example to enable camera
         # permission, just remove the `#` character in front so it looks like this:
         #
         # ## dart: PermissionGroup.camera
         # 'PERMISSION_CAMERA=1'
         #
         #  Preprocessor definitions can be found at: https://github.com/Baseflow/flutter-permission-handler/blob/master/permission_handler_apple/ios/Classes/PermissionHandlerEnums.h
         config.build_settings['GCC_PREPROCESSOR_DEFINITIONS'] ||= [
           '$(inherited)',

           ## dart: PermissionGroup.camera
           'PERMISSION_CAMERA=1',
         ]

       end
       # End of the permission_handler configuration
     end
   end
   ```

## How to use ?

The easiest way to get a list of images is:

```dart
   final imagesPath = await CunningDocumentScanner.getPictures();
```
### Android Specific

There are some features in Android that allow you to adjust the scanner that will be ignored in iOS:

```dart
   final imagesPath = await CunningDocumentScanner.getPictures(
      noOfPages: 1, // Limit the number of pages to 1
      isGalleryImportAllowed, // Allow the user to also pick an image from his gallery
   );
```

### iOS Specific

On iOS it is possible to configure which image format should be used to save of the document scans. Available options are PNG (default) or JPEG. In certain situations the JPEG format could drastically reduce the file size of the final scan. If you choose to use JPEG you can also specify a compression quality, where 0.0 is highest compression (lowest quality) and 1.0 (default) is the lowest compression (highest quality). Example usage is:

```dart
   // Returns images in JPEG format with a compression quality of 50%. 
   final imagesPath = await CunningDocumentScanner.getPictures(
      iosScannerOptions: IosScannerOptions(
         imageFormat: IosImageFormat.jpg,
         jpgCompressionQuality: 0.5,
      ),
   );
```
